ðŸ§¹ Cleaning Data using Excel â€” Real Dataset (US Presidents)
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze, clean, and standardize real-world data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset used contains information about U.S. Presidents, and the goal was to transform inconsistent, unformatted raw data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

Through this project, I showcased my skills in data preprocessing, formula-based transformations, and logical validation steps â€” all without using programming, purely through Excel functions and data tools.
