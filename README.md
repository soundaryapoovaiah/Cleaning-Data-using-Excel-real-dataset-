📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze, clean, and standardize real-world data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset used contains information about U.S. Presidents, and the goal was to transform inconsistent, unformatted raw data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

Through this project, I showcased my skills in data preprocessing, formula-based transformations, and logical validation steps — all without using programming, purely through Excel functions and data tools.

🧠 Key Cleaning Operations Performed

Removed Duplicate Records
Used Remove Duplicates feature to ensure unique records across all entries.

Standardized Text Formatting
Applied =PROPER() to convert inconsistent uppercase/lowercase President names into proper case.

Corrected Party Names
Identified spelling inconsistencies (e.g., Republican vs Republicans) using filters and manually corrected them.

Removed Unnecessary Characters and Spaces
Used =TRIM() to clean extra spaces in the Vice President column.

Cleaned Salary Field
Converted salary values from text to numeric format by removing dollar signs and decimals for database compatibility.

Standardized Date Formats
Applied Short Date format to unify inconsistent date representations.

Deleted Unnecessary Columns
Removed redundant columns (like multiple serial numbers and “Prior” details) to simplify the dataset for analysis.

🧩 Before vs After

Before: Raw, inconsistent data with mixed capitalization, extra spaces, and irregular formats.

After: Clean, uniform, and structured dataset ideal for visualization or database insertion.

🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

Microsoft Excel — formulas (PROPER(), TRIM()), filters, formatting tools, and duplicate removal.

Data Profiling — manual inspection and validation for consistency.

Documentation — created detailed visual report (PDF) explaining the process and rationale for every step.

💡 What I Learned

How to apply data cleaning principles even without programming tools.

The importance of consistency in datasets before analysis or visualization.

Practical use of Excel formulas for automation in cleaning repetitive errors.

🚀 Next Steps

I plan to extend this project by:

Importing the cleaned dataset into Power BI or Tableau for visualization.

Comparing Excel-based cleaning with Python (Pandas)-based cleaning workflows.
